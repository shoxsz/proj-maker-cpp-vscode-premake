# C++ Project Creator

This is a simple tool for creating C++ projects with **vscode** and **premake**, it's purpose is to ease the creation of vscode json files for tasks and launch configurations.


## How to use

You must have premake5 configured in the command line, download it from here https://premake.github.io/ and add the directory where you extracted the **.exe** file to your PATH variable. If you speak portuguese you can follow this blog post https://crackthagamedev.com/posts/setup-cpp-vscode-premake, inside the post search for `Baixar e instalar o Premake`.

You must also have *Build Tools for Visual Studio* installed, it comes with Visual Studio or you can download it independently from the microsoft website, again if you speak portuguese you can follow this blog post https://crackthagamedev.com/posts/setup-cpp-vscode-premake as it explains how the project generated by this tool is configured.

To execute this tool download the source code or clone this repository, I recommend you to install the program with `npm install -g .`, this will make it available anywhere in your computer from the command line, it'll attend by the name `cppproj`. The second option is to run `npm start`. After running the tool, you will be prompted to enter the project location, workspace name, project name, etc. the tool will create the project location you entered, add a `.vscode` folder and populate it with a `tasks.json` and a `launch.json` files, it will also add a `premake5.lua` file with the projects configurations and add a `.bat` file with instructions to open vscode within the **Developer Command Prompt for Vs 2019**.
